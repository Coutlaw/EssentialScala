# Essential Scala

This is is a compilation of scala scratch files that are all of the completed work for the `Essential Scala` and `Scala with Cats` text books. Also insluded is my first attempts at a scala socket server.

# Interesting Sections
Some of the more interesting topics covered in the Scala text books.

3. [ADT's and Sequence computations](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/essentialScala/recursionADT'sSequenceComp.sc)
4. [JSON serialization](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/essentialScala/JSONSerialisation.sc)
5. [Basic Interfaces](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/scalaWithCats/Ch1.1.sc)

6. [Implicit Classes](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/essentialScala/Ch7.3.sc)
7. [Basic Monads](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/scalaWithCats/Ch4.sc)
8. [Higher Kinded Types](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/scalaWithCats/Ch4.2.sc)
9. [Functors](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/scalaWithCats/Ch3.0.sc)
10. [Monoids](https://github.com/Coutlaw/EssentialScala/blob/master/scalaWithCats/Ch2.2.sc)

# To Run
Since all of these are scala.sc files, you can either add them as scratch files in IntelliJ, or you can paste the code in a scala `repl`. This project will not build as a whole and was built to take notes throught the learning process.
